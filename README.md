# Virtual-Body-Scan
Visual measurements and reconstruction of human body for customoriented cloth design.
Version 3.0 @ 2017



The objective of this project is to reconstruct the body shape of a human customer from a video taken by standard mobile device. We are trying to implement the following approaches: 

A) feature-based 3D reconstruction (in SFM_METHOD folder): code currently worked with the help of SFMedu from Princeton

```
Usage: run vBodyScan.m in Matlab
```
B) Visual Hull technique (in SpaceCarving_METHOD folder): code based on SpaceCarving Oxford

```
Usage: run space_carving_demo.m in Matlab
```
